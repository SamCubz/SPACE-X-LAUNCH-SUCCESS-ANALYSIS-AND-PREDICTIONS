# SPACE-X LAUNCH SUCCESS ANALYSIS AND PREDICTIONS
## This project was the grand finale of almost 2 months of learning data analysis and data science techniques. This project included:
- **Data Collection**: Utilizing APIs and web scraping techniques to collect datasets from Wikipedia and Space-X API.
- **Data Cleaning**: Applies data wrangling techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis and data visualization to understand the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements machine learning algorithms to build models for prediction or classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Creates visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present the results effectively.
- **Documentation**: Provides thorough documentation and explanations of the data science workflow and results.

# There are many lines of code for this project, so I am only including the Dash Code and the PowerPoint. There are screenshots of the dash application on the PowerPoint, since I am unable to host the dash application on Github.
